# Week 4, Session 1: Task 1

# There are 5 functions defined below, one for each arithmetic operation
# and one for getting user inputs. Please inspect the code and then
# complete the code for case 1 to case 4.

    return num1 + num2

    if num2 == 0:
        return "Error: cannot divide by zero"
    else:
        return num1 / num2

run_program()


# In the function run_program, they are more than one tasks involved:
#   (1) getting user input for numbers
#   (2) ask user for desired operation
#   (3) match operation.

#    If you are to split each task into a separate function, how would you
#   name the function for each of these tasks?
