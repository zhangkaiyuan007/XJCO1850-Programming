# Additional Work For Week 2

If you finish the tasks quickly and have time on your hands, here are
some other things you can try.

* Lists can be constructed using a feature called a **list comprehension**.
  Investigate this feature, and write some Python code to demonstrate it.

  Do the same for set comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions.

* Given a list `x`, what is the difference between these two lines of code?

  ```python
  x.sort()
  sorted(x)
  ```

* Investigate the following types provided by the `collections` module in
  the Python standard library:

  + `namedtuple`
  + `deque`
  + `Counter`

  In each case, write a small program that demonstrates how the collection
  can be used.

* Investigate the binary sequence type `bytes`. Learn about its relationship
  with the `str` type.

* What does the following Python code return, and why?

  ```python
  answer = False
  isinstance(answer, int)
  ```
