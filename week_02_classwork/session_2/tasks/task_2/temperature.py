# Week 2, Session 2: Task 2
# Temperature Checker

# Prompt the user to enter the temperature in Celsius

temperature = float(input("Enter the temperature in Celsius: "))

# Use an if statement to check the temperature conditions:
# >=23 is hot, >10 is warm, anything below that is cold

if temperature <= 10: 
    # \u00B0 will print the Celsius character
    print(f"{temperature}\u00B0C is cold.")
elif temperature > 10 and temperature < 23: 
    print(f"{temperature}\u00B0C is warm.")
else:
    print(f"{temperature}\u00B0C is hot.")
