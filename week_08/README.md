# Week 8 Worksheet

## Task 1

Use random to implement:

1. A dice roll simulator
2. A grade checker
3. A grade plotter

## Task 2 - Portfolio

Using the Leeds air quality data provided, create a line graph plotting the average air quality against the date.

You must put **your name or student identifier (e.g. abc1234)** into the graph's title, otherwise you will be asked to resubmit it.

Submit a screenshot of your graph as your evidence.

## Task 3 - Extension

Using the basic Flask template provided, try and make a site which allows a user to upload a data file and produce a graph from it.

This will be a challenging task which involves using various other libraries and bits of the Flask ecosystem, so may take a while to do!

A sample sales file is provided, as well as my fake data maker which you can use to produce more data in the same format.
You will need to pip install faker to use it.
