Task 2 is the portfolio task - please ensure that you do not change any file or folder names to allow this to work correctly with the autograder.

You should test your code youself using the provided text file to ensure it is working as expected.

## Task 1

There are 3 files provided to test your code on - these are in the subfolder 'files/'.

Python filenames can include paths, so to use these in your code you need to give them the full path:
'files/story.txt'
You can also concatenate 'files/' to filenames if you don't want to type this out every time :)


## Task 2 - Portfolio

The subdirectory 'example_outfiles' contains the 4 output files produced by the implementation of the program which your code is being tested against. You should use these to compare to your output files and ensure that your files have the same data.

## Task 3 - Extension

For this task, we point you towards [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024), an annual programming challenge; there are a wide variety of tasks available, which have a common focus of file handling.

These are language ambiguous, and usually easily solvable in python which is able to deal with the string-handling needed for them. These are great for a bit of practice, some fun programming challenges, and an opportunity to really put your problem solving skills to the test.

They do ramp up significantly in difficultly, but you can complete previous years' early challenges through the 'Events' button at the top.
