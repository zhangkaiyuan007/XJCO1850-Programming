# Additional Work

This week, the additional work is going to focus on things that anyone who is already familiar with the basics of python can do to practice and get back into the swing of programming.

## Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) is an annual programming challenge which happens in December- it's Christmas themed but has a really nice variety of programming challenges which are personalised to you and range in difficulty from very simple to real brain-twisters.

I recommend having a go at the first few days from previous years' events (you can access these with Events -> pick a year) - you will need to link your Github in order to access your inputs.

All of these challenges will require:
- file handling
- text processing of some sort
- lists or other collections

The challenge is usually more about working out **how** to solve the problem than it is about writing very complex code, so they're great for practice!

## How to Think Like a Computer Scientist - Python

[thinkcspy](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html) is our module text - it's an interactive text book which contains information, quizzes and activities.

You can read ahead, revise anything you're not sure of in advance, or try out their activities to refresh your python knowledge.

## Your Own Projects

While everyone is catching up to the same level with Python, you're welcome to work on your own project - maybe you've got a mod or a game you develop, or you're interesting in spending some time learning a different language? If you're **completely confident** that you've got the skills and knowledge from this week to do the portfolio task, you can use the module time to work on your own project.

Feel free to show your lecturer what you're up to- we're always interested to see what people are developing in their own time :)
