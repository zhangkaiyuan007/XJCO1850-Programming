# This example shows a common while-break pattern - reading from a file

# Test it - you can also modify the text file to add more data 

# We will study this in more detail later on, but in this case we read character by character
# We use 'break' to exit the reading process at the end of the file.

# Why do we use an infinite 'while True' loop for this process?
